Hi,

I think something’s wrong with the MELTCORE 6 inventory system — I’ve been adding purchase orders, but the stock numbers don’t move at all. I finished several orders today, but the quantities in the Inventory module of MELTCORE 6 are exactly the same as before.

I’m not sure if it’s supposed to update automatically or if there’s something I need to do to make it refresh. I also noticed there’s a “Sync” option somewhere in the menus, but I wasn’t sure if using that would mess anything up.

Could someone check if the system is stuck or if I’m missing a step? It’s kind of confusing because everything else seems fine.

Thanks,

Hi Support,

I’m not sure if something changed after the last update, but our MELTCORE 6 system has stopped sending out email notifications. Normally, we get automatic emails when a purchase order is approved or when an invoice is generated, but for the last few days, no one in our team has received any messages.

I checked my spam folder and everything looks fine with our mail server settings as far as I can tell. The system doesn’t show any specific error — it just doesn’t send anything.

Could this be related to some background service or configuration? I’m not sure where to check or if this is something that needs a restart.

Thanks,

Hi Support,

I’m not sure what’s going on, but my internet connection keeps disconnecting every few minutes. Sometimes it says “connected, no internet,” and other times it just drops completely. What’s strange is that other people in the office don’t seem to have this issue, and my phone Wi-Fi works fine on the same network.

I already tried restarting the router (I think?) and reconnecting to the Wi-Fi, but it still happens. Could this be a VPN thing or maybe something wrong with my laptop settings?

Thanks,
